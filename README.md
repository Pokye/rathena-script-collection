# Rathena-Script-Collection
A collection of some scripts I made.

Feel free to use it and open up issues, I'll fix it when I have time. 
You can also open up requests in the issues, I'll also do it when I have the time.
Feel free to modify it and release it with my credits of course.
Just keep my credits and I have no problem with it.

You may not resell it or redistribute it with your name. 

Always load the functions first.
